We address a pressing educational concern by examining dropout rates among high school students in New York State. Using a comprehensive dataset sourced from the New York State Education Department (NYSED) for the 2018-2019 academic year, we aim to uncover patterns and predictors of student dropouts.

The NYSED dataset, accessible at NYSED Data Site, encompasses over 73,000 observations that detail the enrollment and graduation statistics of students across various NY State school districts. Each observation pertains to a distinct student subgroup within a school district, capturing detailed metrics that reflect the educational journey of students who have completed at least four years of high school as of the end of the 2018-2019 school year.

The ability to accurately predict outcomes and trends is vital. For our Module 11 Assignment in DAV 6150, my focus will be on Decision Trees and Random Forests, two powerful techniques commonly used in classification problems. Random Forests often build upon the capabilities of individual Decision Trees by constructing numerous trees and using their collective output to predict data values. This not only typically results in better performance but also introduces a complexity versus performance tradeoff that must be considered.
